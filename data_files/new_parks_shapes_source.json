            "brief_history": "Albion Channel. When Canada Dock was infilled and redesigned in the 1980s an ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created through the site of infilled Albion Dock linking Canada Water to Surrey Water. The spoil was used to create Stave Hill. A timber bridge acts as a gateway and the route acts as a coordinating axis. The channel starts with a section which winds picturesquely winding, but straightens to show it is artificial.\nAlbion Dock. In the 1850s The Grand Surrey Docks and Canal Company bought land from Sir William Maynard Gomm. And they built the new lock, to the north this square, into the Thames along with the Surrey Basin. At the same time construction began on what was initially called Main Dock but was generally known ad Albion Dock. It was built for handling timber and flanked by yards. During the Second World War the northeast side was severely damaged during bombing including two V1s. However after the war the dock was restored and continued to operate until the late 1960s when it Received vessels via the Greenland Entrance. The site is now largely housing.\nAlbion Dock Dry Dock. This was in the south east corner of the dock and has been preserved. It was formed from the cut between the Albion Dock and Albion Pond which was too small for the larger ships which used it once Canada Dock was built. It was retained after the docks were infilled and redeveloped but appears now to be a covered shape with a small inlet off the Albion Channel\nAlbion Pond. This was added to the system as a timber pond called Timber: Pond 1. By 1862 It was designed for floatation and handling of timber. It lay south of Albion Dock and west of Quebec Dock and linked in to both Albion dock and Centre Pond. It was changed when Canada Dock was built. This replaced a third of the pond. Eventually it became part of the extended Canada Dock.",

The site was later brought within the boundaries of the Cathedral parish.\nThe remainder of the bombsite rubble was restored to create an award-winning walled garden with lawns, flower beds and shrubbery. Although owned by Southwark Cathedral, the garden has been managed voluntarily by a local group, the Copperfield Street Community Gardeners for over 40 years and is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the church was used a recording studio, and was associated with some notable artists of the time. In 2001 the studios closed down and the building fell into gradual disrepair. At present the Cathedral has leased the units on a short-term basis to a housing co-operative who are using the former studios for temporary accommodation.",

Although it should be noted that the architect of the church in the street was a William Beatson. It had once been known as Globe Street. It is said by Booth in 1899, to lead to gardens and a century earlier it did lead to an area shown as ‘garden ground’. It now runs pleasantly through a tree lined area past sports fields to Salter Way.\nSt Paul’s Chapel of Ease. This was a Chapel-of-Ease to St Mary's which never had its own parish built abut 1850 by a family member, architect William Beatson., but was consecrated. It had a simple layout with a north-east vestry. There was a small bell turret at the west end In 1892 timber from HMS Temeraire which was being broken up at Beatson’s Yard, was used to construct the altar and altar rails. It was may have been destroyed in Second World War bombing although registers continue to 1955 when it may have been demolished by some sort of mistake and ‘hushed up’. The site was sold to the Greater London Council for the site of the school in the late 1960s.",

That incidentally is why there’s a Peckham Hill street – it’s named after the former owners of the land. It’s said that Bird in Bush Road, which the park sits alongside is named after one of the fields that used to be in the area.\nThe specific details of why the block was demolished have not been found, but the area was suffered a severe decline in the 1970s, being one of the most deprived areas in Western Europe. Many houses in the area became run down and many houses were left empty. It seems that the council bought the entire block in the late 1970s with an intention to clear the land for later redevelopment. The whole block minus the pub on the corner was cleared in 1979.\nAn attempt by the council to then redevelop the land in 1988 was opposed by people living locally, who unsurprisingly liked having a park here, and it’s remained a park ever since.",

It was enlarged in 1874 but there was a great shortage of burial space and by the late C19th it was in a deplorable and neglected state. It was renamed Camberwell Old Cemetery when the Camberwell New Cemetery was opened in 1927 and the majority of burials now take place there.",

As with much of the Docklands, the Surrey Commercial Docks closed in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation took over, and invested heavily in the redevelopment of the area. About half of Canada Dock was infilled and the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre built on top of it; the remainder was converted into the present lake and wildlife refuge. An ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created (through the site of the now filled-in Albion Dock) linking Canada Water to Surrey Water, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill in nearby Russia Dock Woodland.",

            "brief_history": "During the 18th Century the landscape was primarily used for agriculture and was a key area for droving livestock to markets in London. Few dwellings existed in the area at this time, and these consisted of large houses with landscaped gardens. Council records indicate that Greendale itself may never have been built upon. 19th Century \n\n1.22 Throughout the 19th Century there was a step change in the rate of urban expansion in the surrounding area. The arrival of the railway encouraged extensive developments in the area, as the surrounding areas of central London became more accessible. These were generally large houses with landscaped gardens, as seen to the north of the site (1870 OS Map). \n\n1.23 The 1870’s OS Map interestingly highlights an orchard located where the defunct tennis courts are currently found. A croquet lawn is also present (in green). Several ponds (highlighted in blue) are mapped in the local gardens. \n\n1.24 ‘Green Dale’ highlighted in yellow has existed as a public route for at least 140 years. \n\n1.25 The 1890’s OS Map illustrates one of the large residential dwellings to the north of the site has become Pelican House College for girls (purple) and the eastern half of the site has become a part of Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground. The running track to the south was probably part of the Alleyn’s independent school sports facilities. 20th Century \n\n1.26 In the 1910’s, Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground was developed in the current location of the artificial turf. The tennis courts were also built on the site of the croquet court to the north of the Greendale site. \n\n1.27 During this time the site is named Dulwich Grove and Wren Recreational Ground. Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground dominated the current location of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium and Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground. These seem to have acquired a site to the east, adjacent to Dog Kennel Hill. \n\n1.28 Between the 1910’s and 1950’s a large amount of housing development occurred in the area. A housing boom meant that the majority of the open space to the west of the site was developed into semi-detached and terrace housing. To the north of the site, the large, historic dwellings were replaced by large blocks of flats set within a generous amount of open space. Camberwell Workhouse became St Francis Hospital. Dulwich Hamlet Football Ground was created, with a cricket pitch and tennis courts to the north of this. Additional tennis court were built within the northern half of the Greendale site, with the remainder of the site labelled as playing fields, with numerous pavilions.\n\n 1.29 All ponds that previously were shown on the plans have disappeared, probably filled in and any existing water sources culverted. 21st Century\n\n 1.30 The overgrown tennis courts are in the same location that can be seen from the 1910’s map. Generally, the overall layout of the site itself has changed very little over the last 100 years, with the biggest change being the all-weather surface that has been laid to service Dulwich Hamlet FC.\n\n 1.31 Sainsbury’s supermarket has been built on the site of the old football ground that was situated to the north of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium. 1.32 The historic ‘Green Dale’ access still exists as a shared pedestrian and cycle route running north to south, west of the site boundary.\n\nExcerpt taken from Greendale Management Plan - August 2017\n\nLooking at Southwark Councils old digitised maps it would appear that Greendale Fields was probably created some time between 1896 and 1916. Since 1916 it has maintained its current shape. Although whether the whole original area has remained publicly accessible is unclear. Until an exact opening date is found we will classify its opening date as 1875-1899.",

            "brief_history": "Greenland Dock is the oldest of London's riverside wet docks. It was created in 1695-1699 as Howland Great Dock on marshland within a rural area – London was much smaller then. The dock was also about half its present size at that time. At first the dock was used for re-fitting ships of the East India Company. From the 1720s it was used by whaling ships and whale blubber was boiled on the quayside to produce oil. The whaling ships came in from Greenland leading to the dock beng renamed Greenland Dock.\nIn 1806 the dock was sold to a timber merchant who constructed a series of shallow holding docks for timber. Greenland Dock formed part of the Surrey Commercial Docks, which handled 80% of London's timber trade. The dock was expanded to its present size in 1895-1904 and had many interconnecting timber ponds (see picture below). The expansion created a large entrance lock and a depth of 31 feet (9.4m) allowing much bigger ships to enter, such as Cunard A class liners carrying cargo and passengers between London and Canada. (Cunard Walk off Greenland Dock was named after this.)\nIn 1940 the Surrey Commercial Docks, along with major docks on the otherside of the Thames, were bombed at the beginning of the Blitz. On 7 September 1940, 348 German bombers escorted by 617 fighters attacked London in the late afternoon, forming a 20 mile-wide block of aircraft. Many of the bombs falling on the Surrey Docks were strapped to oil drums which ignited the timber ponds. The result was a firestorm that blazed for a whole week and could be seen for miles around. Firefighters came from as far away as Bristol to fight the blazes.\nAfter the war, the docks recovered but changes in shipping (containerisation) brought commercial use of Greenland Dock to an end in the late 1950s. The docks lay derelict until the 1980s when the London Dockland Development Corporation began developing the area. Greenland Dock and South Dock kept their water but many of the timber poinds were filled in. South Dock is nearby on the way to the river and is now a marina. On the otherside of Greenland Dock you will find Norway Dock, where houses are built in the water, and Russia Dock, which has been filled to make an attractive woodland park.",
