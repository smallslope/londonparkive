            "brief_history": "Albion Channel. When Canada Dock was infilled and redesigned in the 1980s an ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created through the site of infilled Albion Dock linking Canada Water to Surrey Water. The spoil was used to create Stave Hill. A timber bridge acts as a gateway and the route acts as a coordinating axis. The channel starts with a section which winds picturesquely winding, but straightens to show it is artificial.\nAlbion Dock. In the 1850s The Grand Surrey Docks and Canal Company bought land from Sir William Maynard Gomm. And they built the new lock, to the north this square, into the Thames along with the Surrey Basin. At the same time construction began on what was initially called Main Dock but was generally known ad Albion Dock. It was built for handling timber and flanked by yards. During the Second World War the northeast side was severely damaged during bombing including two V1s. However after the war the dock was restored and continued to operate until the late 1960s when it Received vessels via the Greenland Entrance. The site is now largely housing.\nAlbion Dock Dry Dock. This was in the south east corner of the dock and has been preserved. It was formed from the cut between the Albion Dock and Albion Pond which was too small for the larger ships which used it once Canada Dock was built. It was retained after the docks were infilled and redeveloped but appears now to be a covered shape with a small inlet off the Albion Channel\nAlbion Pond. This was added to the system as a timber pond called Timber: Pond 1. By 1862 It was designed for floatation and handling of timber. It lay south of Albion Dock and west of Quebec Dock and linked in to both Albion dock and Centre Pond. It was changed when Canada Dock was built. This replaced a third of the pond. Eventually it became part of the extended Canada Dock.",

The site was later brought within the boundaries of the Cathedral parish.\nThe remainder of the bombsite rubble was restored to create an award-winning walled garden with lawns, flower beds and shrubbery. Although owned by Southwark Cathedral, the garden has been managed voluntarily by a local group, the Copperfield Street Community Gardeners for over 40 years and is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the church was used a recording studio, and was associated with some notable artists of the time. In 2001 the studios closed down and the building fell into gradual disrepair. At present the Cathedral has leased the units on a short-term basis to a housing co-operative who are using the former studios for temporary accommodation.",

Although it should be noted that the architect of the church in the street was a William Beatson. It had once been known as Globe Street. It is said by Booth in 1899, to lead to gardens and a century earlier it did lead to an area shown as ‘garden ground’. It now runs pleasantly through a tree lined area past sports fields to Salter Way.\nSt Paul’s Chapel of Ease. This was a Chapel-of-Ease to St Mary's which never had its own parish built abut 1850 by a family member, architect William Beatson., but was consecrated. It had a simple layout with a north-east vestry. There was a small bell turret at the west end In 1892 timber from HMS Temeraire which was being broken up at Beatson’s Yard, was used to construct the altar and altar rails. It was may have been destroyed in Second World War bombing although registers continue to 1955 when it may have been demolished by some sort of mistake and ‘hushed up’. The site was sold to the Greater London Council for the site of the school in the late 1960s.",

That incidentally is why there’s a Peckham Hill street – it’s named after the former owners of the land. It’s said that Bird in Bush Road, which the park sits alongside is named after one of the fields that used to be in the area.\nThe specific details of why the block was demolished have not been found, but the area was suffered a severe decline in the 1970s, being one of the most deprived areas in Western Europe. Many houses in the area became run down and many houses were left empty. It seems that the council bought the entire block in the late 1970s with an intention to clear the land for later redevelopment. The whole block minus the pub on the corner was cleared in 1979.\nAn attempt by the council to then redevelop the land in 1988 was opposed by people living locally, who unsurprisingly liked having a park here, and it’s remained a park ever since.",

It was enlarged in 1874 but there was a great shortage of burial space and by the late C19th it was in a deplorable and neglected state. It was renamed Camberwell Old Cemetery when the Camberwell New Cemetery was opened in 1927 and the majority of burials now take place there.",

As with much of the Docklands, the Surrey Commercial Docks closed in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation took over, and invested heavily in the redevelopment of the area. About half of Canada Dock was infilled and the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre built on top of it; the remainder was converted into the present lake and wildlife refuge. An ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created (through the site of the now filled-in Albion Dock) linking Canada Water to Surrey Water, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill in nearby Russia Dock Woodland.",

            "brief_history": "During the 18th Century the landscape was primarily used for agriculture and was a key area for droving livestock to markets in London. Few dwellings existed in the area at this time, and these consisted of large houses with landscaped gardens. Council records indicate that Greendale itself may never have been built upon. 19th Century \n\n1.22 Throughout the 19th Century there was a step change in the rate of urban expansion in the surrounding area. The arrival of the railway encouraged extensive developments in the area, as the surrounding areas of central London became more accessible. These were generally large houses with landscaped gardens, as seen to the north of the site (1870 OS Map). \n\n1.23 The 1870’s OS Map interestingly highlights an orchard located where the defunct tennis courts are currently found. A croquet lawn is also present (in green). Several ponds (highlighted in blue) are mapped in the local gardens. \n\n1.24 ‘Green Dale’ highlighted in yellow has existed as a public route for at least 140 years. \n\n1.25 The 1890’s OS Map illustrates one of the large residential dwellings to the north of the site has become Pelican House College for girls (purple) and the eastern half of the site has become a part of Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground. The running track to the south was probably part of the Alleyn’s independent school sports facilities. 20th Century \n\n1.26 In the 1910’s, Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground was developed in the current location of the artificial turf. The tennis courts were also built on the site of the croquet court to the north of the Greendale site. \n\n1.27 During this time the site is named Dulwich Grove and Wren Recreational Ground. Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground dominated the current location of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium and Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground. These seem to have acquired a site to the east, adjacent to Dog Kennel Hill. \n\n1.28 Between the 1910’s and 1950’s a large amount of housing development occurred in the area. A housing boom meant that the majority of the open space to the west of the site was developed into semi-detached and terrace housing. To the north of the site, the large, historic dwellings were replaced by large blocks of flats set within a generous amount of open space. Camberwell Workhouse became St Francis Hospital. Dulwich Hamlet Football Ground was created, with a cricket pitch and tennis courts to the north of this. Additional tennis court were built within the northern half of the Greendale site, with the remainder of the site labelled as playing fields, with numerous pavilions.\n\n 1.29 All ponds that previously were shown on the plans have disappeared, probably filled in and any existing water sources culverted. 21st Century\n\n 1.30 The overgrown tennis courts are in the same location that can be seen from the 1910’s map. Generally, the overall layout of the site itself has changed very little over the last 100 years, with the biggest change being the all-weather surface that has been laid to service Dulwich Hamlet FC.\n\n 1.31 Sainsbury’s supermarket has been built on the site of the old football ground that was situated to the north of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium. 1.32 The historic ‘Green Dale’ access still exists as a shared pedestrian and cycle route running north to south, west of the site boundary.\n\nExcerpt taken from Greendale Management Plan - August 2017\n\nLooking at Southwark Councils old digitised maps it would appear that Greendale Fields was probably created some time between 1896 and 1916. Since 1916 it has maintained its current shape. Although whether the whole original area has remained publicly accessible is unclear. Until an exact opening date is found we will classify its opening date as 1875-1899.",

            "brief_history": "Greenland Dock is the oldest of London's riverside wet docks. It was created in 1695-1699 as Howland Great Dock on marshland within a rural area – London was much smaller then. The dock was also about half its present size at that time. At first the dock was used for re-fitting ships of the East India Company. From the 1720s it was used by whaling ships and whale blubber was boiled on the quayside to produce oil. The whaling ships came in from Greenland leading to the dock beng renamed Greenland Dock.\nIn 1806 the dock was sold to a timber merchant who constructed a series of shallow holding docks for timber. Greenland Dock formed part of the Surrey Commercial Docks, which handled 80% of London's timber trade. The dock was expanded to its present size in 1895-1904 and had many interconnecting timber ponds (see picture below). The expansion created a large entrance lock and a depth of 31 feet (9.4m) allowing much bigger ships to enter, such as Cunard A class liners carrying cargo and passengers between London and Canada. (Cunard Walk off Greenland Dock was named after this.)\nIn 1940 the Surrey Commercial Docks, along with major docks on the otherside of the Thames, were bombed at the beginning of the Blitz. On 7 September 1940, 348 German bombers escorted by 617 fighters attacked London in the late afternoon, forming a 20 mile-wide block of aircraft. Many of the bombs falling on the Surrey Docks were strapped to oil drums which ignited the timber ponds. The result was a firestorm that blazed for a whole week and could be seen for miles around. Firefighters came from as far away as Bristol to fight the blazes.\nAfter the war, the docks recovered but changes in shipping (containerisation) brought commercial use of Greenland Dock to an end in the late 1950s. The docks lay derelict until the 1980s when the London Dockland Development Corporation began developing the area. Greenland Dock and South Dock kept their water but many of the timber poinds were filled in. South Dock is nearby on the way to the river and is now a marina. On the otherside of Greenland Dock you will find Norway Dock, where houses are built in the water, and Russia Dock, which has been filled to make an attractive woodland park.",

          "brief_history": "King Edward III is remembered in history for starting the Hundred Years War, annexing large parts of France for England, as well as being the reigning king during the period of the Black Death. What he is infinitely less well-known for, is building a small royal residence at Rotherhithe in South East London, the remains of which can still be seen today.\nWhen the residence was constructed in around 1350, Rotherhithe was a small hamlet set in low lying marshland. The manor house itself was built upon a small island directly next to the River Thames and consisted of a range of stone buildings around a central courtyard.\n\nThere was a moat on three sides of the complex, with the north side being completely open to the River Thames. This allowed the king to arrive by boat and at high tide to moor up against the steps that led from the river to a gatehouse located in a tower. There was also a hall with a large and imposing fireplace, the king’s private chambers, kitchens and other buildings. Further south, on drier land, was an outer court with other buildings surrounded by an earth bank.\n\nSo what was the function of this manor house? It was not a hunting lodge, since there was no attached royal park and Edward III built many hunting lodges elsewhere. Indeed, the most popular theory is that this was where the king practiced his falconry, with the birds being able to stay within eyeshot across the flat marshlands and the River Thames.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century the Thames waterfront had been pushed northwards by land reclamation, and a road had been built along the new river embankment (today this road is known as Bermondsey Wall). By this time the old king’s residence was completely enclosed by the moat, and perhaps due to a lack of enthusiasm for falconry, Edward’s ancestors eventually sold the residence and it passed into private hands.\nIn the 18th century the site became used as a pottery and in the 18th and 19th centuries warehouses were built across the site. In fact the facade of the north wall of the 14th century inner court was still standing in 1907, incorporated into one of the warehouses.\n\nIn the 1970s the warehouses were demolished and in the 1980s the area was redeveloped, allowing historians at the Museum of London to excavate the remains, preserve them and make them accessible to the public.",

In the 1870s the London Brighton and South Coast Railway line from London Bridge to Peckham Rye, Denmark Hill and Victoria was built here on a high enbankment. Residential development took place at the same time, and from the 1870s up to the mid 1970s the area now occupied by the Reserve was terraced housing, in Cossall Street and Sunwell Street (formerly Athearn Road).\n\nIn the 1970s the area was redeveloped with Southwark Council’s new Cossall Housing Estate, and a new road was built on the North side of the railway to extend the North end of Kirkwood Road to meet Queen’s Road. In the late 1990s the North section of this road was partially built over to construct Joe Richards House. The remaining portion of road was removed and the site landscaped to become the Kirkwood Road Nature Garden. The garden was opened in Autumn 2000. Most of the reserve was planted as woodland, with an artificial pond, some open grass areas and a path network. In the following 10 years the woodland has developed and the area is now a significant local wildlife resource.\n\n~ From a sign found in Kirkwood Road Nature Garden",

          "brief_history": "Nunhead Cemetery was one of the 7 great Victorian cemeteries established on the outskirts of London. It was laid out on former farmland, with curving paths and planting that made good use of its hilly site. The path layout and some of the trees from the original planting survive. It had matching entrance lodges and two gothic chapels, only one of which remains and now restored. Although it became fashionable to be buried here, the cemetery suffered when the new Crystal Palace railway blocked the cemetery approach and the company secretary embezzled company funds. Over the C20th the once well-kept cemetery deteriorated and it closed in 1969, badly neglected and subject to attacks by vandals. Purchased by Southwark Council in 1975, it was later restored with the active participation of the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery, and re-opened in 2001, part now a nature reserve.",

In addition to the animals there were ornamental gardens with a large lake and numerous entertainments, which proved very popular with the public. The gardens had declined by 1856 and the animals were sold. Surrey Music Hall was erected on part of the gardens, another popular attraction until 1872. In 1877 the site was sold for development, and terraces of houses built here. In the 1980s part of the former site was laid out as Pasley Park, where in 2010 a Fun Day celebrated the former history of the zoological gardens.",

A new pathway through the site links Surrey Canal Road to Stockholm Street. Local people can also enjoy the grassed areas and wild meadow planting.The main area is planted with 22 new, varied trees and a further 15 trees are located towards the eastern edge of the garden, bringing the council closer to its target of 10,000 new trees by May 2022.A hedge is planted along the main road boundary, offering a screen from the thoroughfare and climbers now scale the fencing. These new plants will provide habitat for birds and other wildlife.",

It contains a water feature that connects streams, a canal and lagoon, and two ponds. Numerous species of trees and shrubs were planted.",

It was built in 1807–1811 just south of the larger Greenland Dock, to which it is connected by a channel now known as Greenland Cut; it also has a lock giving access to the River Thames. Originally named the East Country Dock, it was renamed in 1850 when the Surrey Commercial Dock Company purchased and enlarged it. Timber and grain were the main products imported and exported in the dock.\n\nThe dock was seriously damaged by German attacks in World War II when the area was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. Due to bomb damage in Greenland Dock, South Dock became the only exit from that dock. It was emptied of shipping in 1944, drained and used for the construction of concrete sections for the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. After the war, it was repaired and the surrounding warehouses rebuilt.\n\nThe revival of the Surrey Docks proved short-lived with the advent of containerization from the 1960s onwards. The new container ships were much too big to be accommodated in the upstream London docks and, with a few exceptions, most of the river trade moved downriver to Tilbury and other more modern ports around the country. The Surrey Docks closed in December 1970 and were sold to the London Borough of Southwark in 1977.\n\nAlthough most of the Surrey Docks were infilled and converted to residential, commercial or light industrial land, South Dock escaped this fate. The former warehouses were demolished and replaced with residential blocks, while the dock itself was refurbished. Residential development in the area received funding from the London Docklands Development Corporation erecting unique buildings, such as Baltic Quay. In 1994, South Dock reopened as London's largest marina, with over 200 berths. It is now largely occupied by yachts and residential barges.",

The present church of St Giles was built in 1842-44 when the earlier church was destroyed in a fire in 1841, only its porch remaining. The new church was Sir George Gilbert Scott's first major gothic building. The walled churchyard was in use until 1856, having been enlarged in 1717, 1803 and 1825. After its closure it became neglected and part was lost when Peckham Road was widened. It was cleared of graves in 1939 and laid out as a public garden, with headstones forming a wall on the northern end. It contains mature trees and a few tombs remain in the grass.",

The Docks were closed in 1969, and Stave Hill is an artificial hill created from spoil when the docks were infilled in 1985/9. From the hill are fine views and at the summit is a bronze map by Michael Rizzello, 1986, commissioned by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The hill overlooks a nature reserve created by the Trust for Urban Ecology, which was planted with saplings in 1987. Trees include field maple, alder, ash, birch, aspen, cherry, rowan and oak and numerous shrubs plus a number of ponds.",

The grounds were designed by Humphry Repton, including a large lake that survives as the sole remnant from the earlier landscape. By 1920 Casina was empty and the Estate released the land to Camberwell Borough Council for much needed social housing. A clause in the plans for the new estate enabled an area of open space to be preserved for recreational purposes and the area around the lake was chosen and laid out, initially called Casino Open Space, renamed Sunray Gardens in 1923.",
