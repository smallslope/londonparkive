              "brief_history": "Camberwell was a rural village until the late C18th, and Camberwell Fair was held in August on Camberwell Green for the Feast of St Giles, patron saint of Camberwell, from 1279 until 1855 when it was suppressed as a nuisance to the local residents. In 1856 four local dignitaries purchased exclusive rights for holding the fair on the Green from the Lords of the Manor on a 1,000 year lease with an annual rent of one peppercorn. They sold it to Camberwell Vestry in September 1857 and the Green re-opened as a public open space in 1859. The Green was previously dominated by elm trees and had a pond in the south.",

A drinking fountain was donated by John Passmore Edwards. When the church was bombed, the cross fell into the churchyard scorching the ground, its position now marked by a stone cross in the grass. The garden was redesigned in 2000.",

Although it was refurbished after WWII war damage it became run down. It was renamed and refurbished after local residents set up Friends of Guy Street Park in 2001 following community consultation. It re-opened in 2003 with improved lighting, seating, play areas, a community garden and a community artwork that also provided illumination.",

The garden predated the buildings and was laid out in 1887, the opening ceremony taking place in 1888. It was created to provide 'an open air sitting room for the tired inhabitants of Southwark' and had an elaborate layout of curved lawns, flower beds and serpentine paths, an ornamental pond with fountain, bandstand and covered children's play area. There were once two mosaics in the garden, that depicting 'The Sower' remains, restored in 1956 and again in 2005. During WWII the railings were removed for the war effort and the caretaker dismissed, and by 1948 the layout of the garden had disappeared. Sir Sidney Cockerell writing to The Times of his visit in July 1948 found 'a desolate flat space part of it newly asphalted'. The garden appears treeless in a photograph of 1965, although some trees were subsequently planted. It was not until 2005 that it was restored to much of its original layout through the work of Bankside Open Spaces Trust with support by local people and funding from HLF and Southwark Council. It reflects its Victorian origins as a community garden and combines C19th and ecological planting.",

After he moved to Surrey, Evelyn let Sayes Court, including for a short time to Peter the Great of Russia in 1698, who was studying ship building at the Royal Dockyard nearby. The mansion was demolished in 1729 and a workhouse built on the site, later converted as almshouses by a descendent of Evelyn. In 1878 he laid out part of the land as a recreation ground initially for his tenants, but later a park of 1.5 acres was opened as a public facility. Requisitioned during WWII, the park was later re-landscaped by the LCC and opened in 1952.",

Adjoining it was a paupers' burial ground of St Olave's, now part of Potters Fields Park. St John's churchyard was laid out as public gardens in 1882.

Christ Church, Saint Paul, Saint Anne, Saint Crispin, Saint Augustine and Saint Luke all followed between 1845 and 1885. The medieval church building was rebuilt in the seventeenth century, and later added to and restored, particularly in 1883.",

Pressure for a public park in the area began in the 1850s and in 1857 the new Metropolitan Board of Works was persuaded that Bermondsey and Rotherhithe, as well as Finsbury, were most in need and a site was approved. Southwark Park was laid out by the MBW and opened on 19 June 1869. The original layout had a wide carriage drive around the perimeter, part of which survives; various facilities were added by 1885, including a new lake and a bandstand, and in the early C20th a lido and the Ada Salter Rose Garden were among the new facilities. Rundown in the latter C20th, it was very well restored by 2001 with HLF funding, the works including a replica bandstand and bowling pavilion, and the lake restored to its original pre-WWII size and the main gates repaired. Other facilities include a cafe, visitor’s centre, art gallery, sports track and wildlife area.",

When the riverside area became derelict, an ecology park was created here in 1977, remaining until 1985. The park combining these two areas was laid out in 1988 and opened as Potters Fields Park, recalling the pottery works that had existed here in the C17th. The park was re-designed in 2007. When it first opened as a recreation ground in the late C19th, the park was known as The Tooley Street Garden, but it was re-named Potters Fields Park in 2006.",

It was created as a children's playground by the LCC's Parks and Open Spaces Committee, and was opened in 1902 by the LCC Councillor for Rotherhithe, Mr A Pomeroy-Cragg, at a ceremony accompanied by music from the North London Prize Band. Improvement works were carried out in 2001 by Little Dorrit Park Group, set up by group of local mothers including artist Danuta Solowig Wedderburn who created bronze plaques. Works included playground improvements and landscaping and the park is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).",

It opened to the public in February 1904. There was formerly a bandstand and ornamental drinking fountain presented by the MPGA. The garden has 6 mature plane trees but is now mainly laid out as a tarmac playground, alongside which is a small rose garden with ornamental planting.",

Rotherhithe had strong maritime connections, with many seafarers among its parishioners. In 1620 The Mayflower sailed from here to pick up the Pilgrim Fathers, and three of its four part-owners were buried in Rotherhithe churchyard. An unusual memorial in the churchyard is that of Prince Lee Boo (d.1784), the son of the King of the Belau Islands, whose monument was erected by the East India Company. The churchyard immediately adjacent to the church was opened to the public in 1909, while the main part of the churchyard had been opened as a public garden in 1901, now called St Mary's Churchyard Gardens.",

After 1787 Dulwich tenants lost their common rights following the Enclosure Acts, although the woods survived until the development of Crystal Palace following the Great Exhibition, which led to housing development. The steep slope of woodland running west from Sydenham Hill became the gardens of several Victorian houses, since demolished, their gardens are now back within the woodland. Although the gardens have disappeared, evidence remains in the form of exotic garden trees, and fragments of built features. Also within the woods is the disused railway track of the Crystal Palace High Level Railway.",

The architect was Charles Barry and Son and the site was donated by Dulwich College. The foundation stone was laid by the famous actor Sir Henry Irving on 24 September 1896 and the library was declared open by Lord Chancellor Halsbury on the 24 November 1897.\n\nThe building probably originally operated on a closed access system where books could be selected from a catalogue and retrieved by staff for viewing. The original single-storey wing to the west of the main entrance was rebuilt in about 1950 following bomb damage in 1940 or 1941.\n\nThe building was refurbished in 2013.",

The most famous story in its history is that Elizabeth I rested under an oak at the summit in 1602, and the third successive specimen planted in 1905 remains today. In 1896 the hill was enclosed when the adjacent Golf Club rented the land, but following an active local protest it was eventually opened as a public park in 1905, the LCC General Powers Bill of 1902 having enabled Camberwell Borough Council to compulsorily purchase the land as public open space.",

The land between South Grove and the rear of houses in Elm Grove was purchased by Camberwell Borough Council in 1896 for £966, which represented paving charges from which the owners were released, and the land was laid out as a shrubbery with the pathway along its length and opened to the public in 1897. It was extended In 1902 when further land was purchased for £350.",

When the houses were demolished and replaced by a Board School the garden survived and was purchased by the Vestry of St George the Martyr. It was laid out as public garden by the MPGA and once had a bandstand. Part of the site was later lost as a result of road schemes when the Bricklayers Arms Flyover was built in 1970 although a strip of land was added to the west as compensation and planted with shrubs. Improvements have been carried out since 2009 as part of wider improvements to the Salisbury Row neighbourhood.",

When the Bethlehem Royal Hospital moved to St George's Fields, its senior hospital staff needed accommodation nearby and West Square was laid out with terraces surrounding the garden. By 1813 it appears to have had a formal layout but it was much simplified by 1870. Threatened with development in the late C19th, the garden was saved for public open space by the MPGA in 1909, and laid out by their landscape gardener Madeline Agar. The cruciform layout was restored and the garden opened to the public in 1910. In the centre is a rose garden with sundial; a tree was planted here on 14 September 1991 to celebrate the bicentenary of West Square. The garden at one point had 4 black mulberries.",

              "brief_history": "Work began after WWII to provide the new public space that eventually became Burgess Park. It was the result of initiatives such as the Abercrombie Plan of 1943 and was created by demolishing numerous houses, streets, churches and factories, and infilling the disused Grand Surrey Canal. Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden. Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed. You can refer to the areas that were opened before this time by viewing the map through the Alterations View Mode.",

It was the result of initiatives such as the Abercrombie Plan of 1943 and was created by demolishing numerous houses, streets, churches and factories, and infilling the disused Grand Surrey Canal. Existing green spaces were incorporated into the new North Camberwell Open Space, which by 1965 covered c.16 hectares. It was named Burgess Park in 1973 after Alderman Jessie Burgess, first lady Mayor of Camberwell. The fragmented open spaces were consolidated from 1982 onwards and in 1985/6 Southwark Council took over responsibility and began purchasing remaining properties and clearing the site, a process completed in 1995. Numerous projects have been undertaken, including planting 1000s of trees, provision of sports facilities, greening the canal route and creation of the lake. Within the park are the former Chumleigh Gardens Almshouses, which now house a café, meeting rooms as well as a World Garden and an English Garden. Due to the complex evolutionary nature of the formation of Burgess Park, the London Parkive has chosen to depict Burgess Parks opening date as 1995, at the point at which its consolidation was completed. You can refer to the areas that were opened before this time by viewing the map through the Alterations View Mode.",

Addington Square was built between 1810 and 1850, when the area was still mostly fields and market gardens, and became home to the well-to-do escaping densely populated central London. It had a canal and two swimming baths by 1840…. The square forms part of the earliest housing to be developed in the park area, dating from the beginning of the 19th century. The square was laid out some time between 1800 and 1810. The fourth, northern, side of the square was home to one of south London’s first swimming baths, which opened in 1820. Another outdoor pool opened a few years later, also on the canal bank, behind the houses on the east side of the square… At the peak of the squares decline, in the 1960s, South London gangsters the Richardson brothers, Charlie and Eddie, established Peckford scrap merchants in nearby New Church Road, and a base in the square, at number 33. They later spent a lot of time in gaol, and their exploits have been documented in books, films and an art show in the square. The council refuse depot on the north side later formed the basis of the first piece of recreational land in the area, which was eventually to become Burgess Park.",

After the hospital closed the buildings were demolished and the site became green space. Mint Street Park was re-landscaped by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST) working with local people to carry out improvements that included new landscaping, access and lighting. Raised beds were created and planted by the gardening club working with Putting Down Roots, a project run by St Mungo's Association working with homeless people. Mint Street Park is now s a local play space and venue for community events, and includes an adventure play facility.",

When Canada Dock was infilled and redesigned in the 1980s an ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created through the site of infilled Albion Dock linking Canada Water to Surrey Water. The spoil was used to create Stave Hill. A timber bridge acts as a gateway and the route acts as a coordinating axis. The channel starts with a section which winds picturesquely winding, but straightens to show it is artificial.\nAlbion Dock. In the 1850s The Grand Surrey Docks and Canal Company bought land from Sir William Maynard Gomm. And they built the new lock, to the north this square, into the Thames along with the Surrey Basin. At the same time construction began on what was initially called Main Dock but was generally known ad Albion Dock. It was built for handling timber and flanked by yards. During the Second World War the northeast side was severely damaged during bombing including two V1s. However after the war the dock was restored and continued to operate until the late 1960s when it Received vessels via the Greenland Entrance. The site is now largely housing.\nAlbion Dock Dry Dock. This was in the south east corner of the dock and has been preserved. It was formed from the cut between the Albion Dock and Albion Pond which was too small for the larger ships which used it once Canada Dock was built. It was retained after the docks were infilled and redeveloped but appears now to be a covered shape with a small inlet off the Albion Channel\nAlbion Pond. This was added to the system as a timber pond called Timber: Pond 1. By 1862 It was designed for floatation and handling of timber. It lay south of Albion Dock and west of Quebec Dock and linked in to both Albion dock and Centre Pond. It was changed when Canada Dock was built. This replaced a third of the pond. Eventually it became part of the extended Canada Dock.",

The site was later brought within the boundaries of the Cathedral parish.\nThe remainder of the bombsite rubble was restored to create an award-winning walled garden with lawns, flower beds and shrubbery. Although owned by Southwark Cathedral, the garden has been managed voluntarily by a local group, the Copperfield Street Community Gardeners for over 40 years and is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the church was used a recording studio, and was associated with some notable artists of the time. In 2001 the studios closed down and the building fell into gradual disrepair. At present the Cathedral has leased the units on a short-term basis to a housing co-operative who are using the former studios for temporary accommodation.",

Although it should be noted that the architect of the church in the street was a William Beatson. It had once been known as Globe Street. It is said by Booth in 1899, to lead to gardens and a century earlier it did lead to an area shown as ‘garden ground’. It now runs pleasantly through a tree lined area past sports fields to Salter Way.\nSt Paul’s Chapel of Ease. This was a Chapel-of-Ease to St Mary's which never had its own parish built abut 1850 by a family member, architect William Beatson., but was consecrated. It had a simple layout with a north-east vestry. There was a small bell turret at the west end In 1892 timber from HMS Temeraire which was being broken up at Beatson’s Yard, was used to construct the altar and altar rails. It was may have been destroyed in Second World War bombing although registers continue to 1955 when it may have been demolished by some sort of mistake and ‘hushed up’. The site was sold to the Greater London Council for the site of the school in the late 1960s.",

That incidentally is why there’s a Peckham Hill street – it’s named after the former owners of the land. It’s said that Bird in Bush Road, which the park sits alongside is named after one of the fields that used to be in the area.\nThe specific details of why the block was demolished have not been found, but the area was suffered a severe decline in the 1970s, being one of the most deprived areas in Western Europe. Many houses in the area became run down and many houses were left empty. It seems that the council bought the entire block in the late 1970s with an intention to clear the land for later redevelopment. The whole block minus the pub on the corner was cleared in 1979.\nAn attempt by the council to then redevelop the land in 1988 was opposed by people living locally, who unsurprisingly liked having a park here, and it’s remained a park ever since.",

The cemetery originally had 3 chapels, none of which remains although the gothic entrance lodge still stands. Its layout was planned on picturesque principles with winding paths. It was enlarged in 1874 but there was a great shortage of burial space and by the late C19th it was in a deplorable and neglected state. It was renamed Camberwell Old Cemetery when the Camberwell New Cemetery was opened in 1927 and the majority of burials now take place there.",

As with much of the Docklands, the Surrey Commercial Docks closed in the 1970s. During the 1980s, the London Docklands Development Corporation took over, and invested heavily in the redevelopment of the area. About half of Canada Dock was infilled and the Surrey Quays Shopping Centre built on top of it; the remainder was converted into the present lake and wildlife refuge. An ornamental canal, Albion Channel, was created (through the site of the now filled-in Albion Dock) linking Canada Water to Surrey Water, with the spoil used to create Stave Hill in nearby Russia Dock Woodland.",

              "brief_history": "During the 18th Century the landscape was primarily used for agriculture and was a key area for droving livestock to markets in London. Few dwellings existed in the area at this time, and these consisted of large houses with landscaped gardens. Council records indicate that Greendale itself may never have been built upon. 19th Century \n\n1.22 Throughout the 19th Century there was a step change in the rate of urban expansion in the surrounding area. The arrival of the railway encouraged extensive developments in the area, as the surrounding areas of central London became more accessible. These were generally large houses with landscaped gardens, as seen to the north of the site (1870 OS Map). \n\n1.23 The 1870’s OS Map interestingly highlights an orchard located where the defunct tennis courts are currently found. A croquet lawn is also present (in green). Several ponds (highlighted in blue) are mapped in the local gardens. \n\n1.24 ‘Green Dale’ highlighted in yellow has existed as a public route for at least 140 years. \n\n1.25 The 1890’s OS Map illustrates one of the large residential dwellings to the north of the site has become Pelican House College for girls (purple) and the eastern half of the site has become a part of Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground. The running track to the south was probably part of the Alleyn’s independent school sports facilities. 20th Century \n\n1.26 In the 1910’s, Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground was developed in the current location of the artificial turf. The tennis courts were also built on the site of the croquet court to the north of the Greendale site. \n\n1.27 During this time the site is named Dulwich Grove and Wren Recreational Ground. Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground dominated the current location of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium and Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground. These seem to have acquired a site to the east, adjacent to Dog Kennel Hill. \n\n1.28 Between the 1910’s and 1950’s a large amount of housing development occurred in the area. A housing boom meant that the majority of the open space to the west of the site was developed into semi-detached and terrace housing. To the north of the site, the large, historic dwellings were replaced by large blocks of flats set within a generous amount of open space. Camberwell Workhouse became St Francis Hospital. Dulwich Hamlet Football Ground was created, with a cricket pitch and tennis courts to the north of this. Additional tennis court were built within the northern half of the Greendale site, with the remainder of the site labelled as playing fields, with numerous pavilions.\n\n 1.29 All ponds that previously were shown on the plans have disappeared, probably filled in and any existing water sources culverted. 21st Century\n\n 1.30 The overgrown tennis courts are in the same location that can be seen from the 1910’s map. Generally, the overall layout of the site itself has changed very little over the last 100 years, with the biggest change being the all-weather surface that has been laid to service Dulwich Hamlet FC.\n\n 1.31 Sainsbury’s supermarket has been built on the site of the old football ground that was situated to the north of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium. 1.32 The historic ‘Green Dale’ access still exists as a shared pedestrian and cycle route running north to south, west of the site boundary.\n\nExcerpt taken from Greendale Management Plan - August 2017\n\nLooking at Southwark Councils old digitised maps it would appear that Greendale Fields was probably created some time between 1896 and 1916. Since 1916 it has maintained its current shape. Although whether the whole original area has remained publicly accessible is unclear. Until an exact opening date is found we will classify its opening date as 1875-1899.",

              "brief_history": "Greenland Dock is the oldest of London's riverside wet docks. It was created in 1695-1699 as Howland Great Dock on marshland within a rural area – London was much smaller then. The dock was also about half its present size at that time. At first the dock was used for re-fitting ships of the East India Company. From the 1720s it was used by whaling ships and whale blubber was boiled on the quayside to produce oil. The whaling ships came in from Greenland leading to the dock beng renamed Greenland Dock.\nIn 1806 the dock was sold to a timber merchant who constructed a series of shallow holding docks for timber. Greenland Dock formed part of the Surrey Commercial Docks, which handled 80% of London's timber trade. The dock was expanded to its present size in 1895-1904 and had many interconnecting timber ponds (see picture below). The expansion created a large entrance lock and a depth of 31 feet (9.4m) allowing much bigger ships to enter, such as Cunard A class liners carrying cargo and passengers between London and Canada. (Cunard Walk off Greenland Dock was named after this.)\nIn 1940 the Surrey Commercial Docks, along with major docks on the otherside of the Thames, were bombed at the beginning of the Blitz. On 7 September 1940, 348 German bombers escorted by 617 fighters attacked London in the late afternoon, forming a 20 mile-wide block of aircraft. Many of the bombs falling on the Surrey Docks were strapped to oil drums which ignited the timber ponds. The result was a firestorm that blazed for a whole week and could be seen for miles around. Firefighters came from as far away as Bristol to fight the blazes.\nAfter the war, the docks recovered but changes in shipping (containerisation) brought commercial use of Greenland Dock to an end in the late 1950s. The docks lay derelict until the 1980s when the London Dockland Development Corporation began developing the area. Greenland Dock and South Dock kept their water but many of the timber poinds were filled in. South Dock is nearby on the way to the river and is now a marina. On the otherside of Greenland Dock you will find Norway Dock, where houses are built in the water, and Russia Dock, which has been filled to make an attractive woodland park.",

What he is infinitely less well-known for, is building a small royal residence at Rotherhithe in South East London, the remains of which can still be seen today.\nWhen the residence was constructed in around 1350, Rotherhithe was a small hamlet set in low lying marshland. The manor house itself was built upon a small island directly next to the River Thames and consisted of a range of stone buildings around a central courtyard.\n\nThere was a moat on three sides of the complex, with the north side being completely open to the River Thames. This allowed the king to arrive by boat and at high tide to moor up against the steps that led from the river to a gatehouse located in a tower. There was also a hall with a large and imposing fireplace, the king’s private chambers, kitchens and other buildings. Further south, on drier land, was an outer court with other buildings surrounded by an earth bank.\n\nSo what was the function of this manor house? It was not a hunting lodge, since there was no attached royal park and Edward III built many hunting lodges elsewhere. Indeed, the most popular theory is that this was where the king practiced his falconry, with the birds being able to stay within eyeshot across the flat marshlands and the River Thames.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century the Thames waterfront had been pushed northwards by land reclamation, and a road had been built along the new river embankment (today this road is known as Bermondsey Wall). By this time the old king’s residence was completely enclosed by the moat, and perhaps due to a lack of enthusiasm for falconry, Edward’s ancestors eventually sold the residence and it passed into private hands.\nIn the 18th century the site became used as a pottery and in the 18th and 19th centuries warehouses were built across the site. In fact the facade of the north wall of the 14th century inner court was still standing in 1907, incorporated into one of the warehouses.\n\nIn the 1970s the warehouses were demolished and in the 1980s the area was redeveloped, allowing historians at the Museum of London to excavate the remains, preserve them and make them accessible to the public.",

In the 1870s the London Brighton and South Coast Railway line from London Bridge to Peckham Rye, Denmark Hill and Victoria was built here on a high enbankment. Residential development took place at the same time, and from the 1870s up to the mid 1970s the area now occupied by the Reserve was terraced housing, in Cossall Street and Sunwell Street (formerly Athearn Road).\n\nIn the 1970s the area was redeveloped with Southwark Council’s new Cossall Housing Estate, and a new road was built on the North side of the railway to extend the North end of Kirkwood Road to meet Queen’s Road. In the late 1990s the North section of this road was partially built over to construct Joe Richards House. The remaining portion of road was removed and the site landscaped to become the Kirkwood Road Nature Garden. The garden was opened in Autumn 2000. Most of the reserve was planted as woodland, with an artificial pond, some open grass areas and a path network. In the following 10 years the woodland has developed and the area is now a significant local wildlife resource.\n\n~ From a sign found in Kirkwood Road Nature Garden",

It was laid out on former farmland, with curving paths and planting that made good use of its hilly site. The path layout and some of the trees from the original planting survive. It had matching entrance lodges and two gothic chapels, only one of which remains and now restored. Although it became fashionable to be buried here, the cemetery suffered when the new Crystal Palace railway blocked the cemetery approach and the company secretary embezzled company funds. Over the C20th the once well-kept cemetery deteriorated and it closed in 1969, badly neglected and subject to attacks by vandals. Purchased by Southwark Council in 1975, it was later restored with the active participation of the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery, and re-opened in 2001, part now a nature reserve.",

In addition to the animals there were ornamental gardens with a large lake and numerous entertainments, which proved very popular with the public. The gardens had declined by 1856 and the animals were sold. Surrey Music Hall was erected on part of the gardens, another popular attraction until 1872. In 1877 the site was sold for development, and terraces of houses built here. In the 1980s part of the former site was laid out as Pasley Park, where in 2010 a Fun Day celebrated the former history of the zoological gardens.",

A new pathway through the site links Surrey Canal Road to Stockholm Street. Local people can also enjoy the grassed areas and wild meadow planting.The main area is planted with 22 new, varied trees and a further 15 trees are located towards the eastern edge of the garden, bringing the council closer to its target of 10,000 new trees by May 2022.A hedge is planted along the main road boundary, offering a screen from the thoroughfare and climbers now scale the fencing. These new plants will provide habitat for birds and other wildlife.",

Surrey Docks came to cover over 185 hectares, and was particularly important for imported timber. The Docks were finally closed in 1969; the linear wooded park was created by LB Southwark in 1980 from the former Russia Dock basin and part of the old canal wall and boat moorings are still visible. It contains a water feature that connects streams, a canal and lagoon, and two ponds. Numerous species of trees and shrubs were planted.",

              "brief_history": "South Dock is one of two surviving docks in the former Surrey Commercial Docks in Rotherhithe, London, England. It was built in 1807–1811 just south of the larger Greenland Dock, to which it is connected by a channel now known as Greenland Cut; it also has a lock giving access to the River Thames. Originally named the East Country Dock, it was renamed in 1850 when the Surrey Commercial Dock Company purchased and enlarged it. Timber and grain were the main products imported and exported in the dock.\n\nThe dock was seriously damaged by German attacks in World War II when the area was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. Due to bomb damage in Greenland Dock, South Dock became the only exit from that dock. It was emptied of shipping in 1944, drained and used for the construction of concrete sections for the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. After the war, it was repaired and the surrounding warehouses rebuilt.\n\nThe revival of the Surrey Docks proved short-lived with the advent of containerization from the 1960s onwards. The new container ships were much too big to be accommodated in the upstream London docks and, with a few exceptions, most of the river trade moved downriver to Tilbury and other more modern ports around the country. The Surrey Docks closed in December 1970 and were sold to the London Borough of Southwark in 1977.\n\nAlthough most of the Surrey Docks were infilled and converted to residential, commercial or light industrial land, South Dock escaped this fate. The former warehouses were demolished and replaced with residential blocks, while the dock itself was refurbished. Residential development in the area received funding from the London Docklands Development Corporation erecting unique buildings, such as Baltic Quay. In 1994, South Dock reopened as London's largest marina, with over 200 berths. It is now largely occupied by yachts and residential barges.",

              "brief_history": "The medieval church of St Giles served a large parish comprising the villages at Camberwell, Peckham and Dulwich, the area later engulfed by housing. The present church of St Giles was built in 1842-44 when the earlier church was destroyed in a fire in 1841, only its porch remaining. The new church was Sir George Gilbert Scott's first major gothic building. The walled churchyard was in use until 1856, having been enlarged in 1717, 1803 and 1825. After its closure it became neglected and part was lost when Peckham Road was widened. It was cleared of graves in 1939 and laid out as a public garden, with headstones forming a wall on the northern end. It contains mature trees and a few tombs remain in the grass.",

The Docks were closed in 1969, and Stave Hill is an artificial hill created from spoil when the docks were infilled in 1985/9. From the hill are fine views and at the summit is a bronze map by Michael Rizzello, 1986, commissioned by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The hill overlooks a nature reserve created by the Trust for Urban Ecology, which was planted with saplings in 1987. Trees include field maple, alder, ash, birch, aspen, cherry, rowan and oak and numerous shrubs plus a number of ponds.",

The grounds were designed by Humphry Repton, including a large lake that survives as the sole remnant from the earlier landscape. By 1920 Casina was empty and the Estate released the land to Camberwell Borough Council for much needed social housing. A clause in the plans for the new estate enabled an area of open space to be preserved for recreational purposes and the area around the lake was chosen and laid out, initially called Casino Open Space, renamed Sunray Gardens in 1923.",

The excerpt below is referring to Lock Burial Ground.\n\n\"St George the Martyr had acquired an additional burial ground in 1711. This was situated in Kent Street near the Lock Hospital and next to St Saviour's and St Olave's Girls' School. It was extended in 1744 and, after its closure, was laid out as a public garden by the vestry in 1887.\"\n\nThe exact location of Lock Burial Ground was determined by looking at Southwark Council’s digitised historic maps. On a map dated 1873-1876 Lock Burial Ground is labelled as a disused burial ground. It can be found on multiple maps following that date but on a map dated 1951 the burial ground is no longer on the map. In it’s place is a blank space. Presumably the burial ground was closed and flattened sometime between 1916 and 1951.\n\n‘The Pilgrim Fathers Memorial Church, which originally stood at Deadman’s Place in Bankside was relocated in 1864 to Buckenham Square, close to this site. Its gardens were named the Mayflower Gardens and contained a memorial to the ship; a sundial set on a large stone with a panel depicting the Mayflower on one side. When the Bricklayers Arms flyover was built in the 1970s there was much disruption. The Pilgrim church moved to Great Dover Street but Mayflower Gardens was left behind, complete with its monument. St Saviour’s & St Olave’s School for Girls was built close by, and the memorial is now inside.’\n\nThe excerpt clearly mentions the fact that Mayflower Gardens is now located within St. Saviour’s & St. Olave’s School for girls. If you look on their website there is also reference to Mayflower Gardens being a part of the schools outdoor area. \n\nOn a map dated 2002, Mayflower Garden is still located adjacent to the school which would then suggest that Mayflower Garden stopped being publicly accessible sometime between 2002 and now.",

It was opened in 1934 by Lord Snell, then Chairman of the LCC. Within the park is the remains of the hospital building, which was converted into the Imperial War Museum in the 1930s. The park features mature trees and is an important green space in this crowded area of Southwark.",

The garden has been completely re-landscaped. According to the Greening of London 1920-2000 by Matti O. Hannikainen, David Copperfield Gardens was acquired by the LCC in 1929. Looking at Southwark Council’s old digitised maps it would appear that the land was laid out as a garden around that time.",

In 1938, Bermondsey Borough Council used a grant of £500 from the King George's Fields Foundation to convert a piece of land close to All Saints Church into a simple, hard-surfaced recreation area for children. This was a small but popular addition to the church's existing public garden, which had seats and formal bedding set around pathways in a pleasing oval shape.\nDuring the Second World War the church was badly I bomb damaged, and, in 1950, a strip of land to the east of the churchyard extended King George's Field further, alongside what is now Surrey Quays Road. Around 1960, most probably as part of the wider Canada Estate Housing Scheme, the park was enlarged when All Saints Church and Vicarage were finally demolished. The churchyard gardens were cleared, the pathways reshaped and a new main entrance was located on Lower Road.",

The linear gardens were opened in 1928, laid out on a steeply sloping site with a sunken garden and ornamental displays. The old track bed of the Crystal Palace High Level Railway was incorporated into the garden after its closure in 1954. At that time the rockery / shrubbery overlooking Forest Hill Road was created at the south end and the track-bed provided a glade alongside the original area of the park. Recent improvements have included restoration of the 'Sunken Garden', the railings have been repainted and part of the granite embankment walling has been replaced. Adjacent is the Aquarius Golf Course and the Waterworks",

Renamed Belair in c.1829, the estate remained in private ownership until 1938. In WWII house and grounds were requisitioned for wartime use, the grounds cultivated as allotments. After the war the estate was acquired by the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark as a quasi-country club facility accessible to Southwark residents, and the house was restored. When the new Borough of Southwark was created in 1965, controlled use of Belair ceased and it was opened as a public park. The mansion was let and has been run as a restaurant in recent years.",

It was created through clearance of terraced housing but was near the former site of Bermondsey Spa after which it is named. These pleasure gardens had been opened in c.1765 and so-called after a spring was found in the grounds. Bermondsey Spa Gardens were refurbished as part of the 1999 area master plan and re-opened in spring 2006 with new seating, lighting, a toddlers' play area, a multiuse games area, a dog walking area, a 333m running track, a plaza and the Ellen Brown Bermondsey Play Centre.",

              "brief_history": "The site where Bermondsey Square is today is best known as the site of Bermondsey Abbey which at its height rivalled nearby Westminster Abbey and was an economic powerhouse as well as a spiritual one.\nThe monastery became the Priory of St Saviour in 1089, attached to the French Abbey of Cluny making it an ‘alien property’. In 1380 Richard Dunton, the first English prior, paid a fine of 200 marks (£133.33) to have the Priory naturalised: this protected it from actions taken against alien properties in time of war, but it also set the priory on the path to independent status which it achieved in 1390 by becoming Bermondsey Abbey.\nBermondsey Abbey rapidly acquired a valuable estate, including properties in Surrey, Leicestershire, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Kent. In 1268, Bermondsey was granted a Monday market at Charlton as well as an annual fair of three days centred on Trinity Sunday, the eighth Sunday after Easter. By 1535 the abbey’s clear annual income was valued at a little over £474, equivalent to over £7 million today.\nBermondsey Abbey was dissolved in 1537 by Henry VIII, and the estate was acquired by Sir Thomas Pope (founder of Trinity College Oxford) who broke up the Abbey buildings and built a mansion for himself.\nParts of Bermondsey Abbey remain visible today. The remains of the south-western tower of the Abbey church can be seen below the glass floor of the Lokma Turkish Grill & Bar on Bermondsey Square and houses on nearby Grange Walk incorporate some of the Abbey’s remains. Within the structure of the late 17th century Grade II-listed houses numbered 5, 6 and 7 are part of one side of the late medieval stone gatehouse. At number 7 is the chamfered south jamb of the gateway with two wrought-iron gate hooks projecting from the wall and a ‘Gatehouse’ sign.",

It faced onto a road that became known as Chapel Place and the burial ground lay behind the chapel, away from the street. It closed for burials in the 1850s and Mrs Basil Holmes in her book London Burial Grounds, published in 1896, described it as closed with a few gravestones and a hen coop.",

Ada saw the opportunity to create a park on the site, and drew up the plans for it to include typical Ada features such as \"trees, a children's' play park, a professional gardener and a bathing pool\" (quoted from Ada Salter, 'Pioneer of Ethical Socialism' by Graham Taylor). Although Shuttleworth Park was not built until after the war and after Ada's death, it was built to her original design.",

The first stone was laid on 21st February 1827. The church was consecrated by Dr Sumner, Bishop of Winchester, on May 7th 1829. Initially the church encountered some financial difficulty, however by 1840 the last loan had been repaid and the church was free of debt.The parish of Saint James was formed in 1840, from part of the parish of Saint Mary Magdalene. The creation of new parish in the Bermondsey area was necessitated by a great increase in population. The advowson of the parish was held by the rector of Bermondsey.",

The building was altered and extended, but was always subject to flooding and frequently overcrowded. Over the years conditions improved although it was never, nor was it intended to be, a welcoming place. It became known locally as ‘the Bastille’, formidable and dreaded by all.\nThe long and sometimes distressing history of the workhouse came to an end when, by 1928, it was closed and finally demolished. Bermondsey Borough Council owned half the site and the other half was purchased from charity trustees on condition that it was used as an open space. Estimates were obtained by the Borough Council but further funding was needed to cover the expense of providing a park and recreation area. Dr Alfred Salter, a well-respected local physician was returned three times as MP for West Bermondsey. Motivated by a concern with public health and especially the health and welfare of children, he played a significant role in the story of Tanner Street Park.",
