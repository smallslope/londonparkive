    "brief_history": "The original All Hallows’ Church was a fine example of Victorian gothic architecture built by George Gilbert Scott Junior in 1879-80\nIt was almost entirely destroyed during the Blitz and fragments of the building remain, including two stone archways and a chapel, all incorporated into a rebuilding of the north aisle of the church in 1957.  This was closed in 1971. The site was later brought within the boundaries of the Cathedral parish.\nThe remainder of the bombsite rubble was restored to create an award-winning walled garden with lawns, flower beds and shrubbery. Although owned by Southwark Cathedral, the garden has been managed voluntarily by a local group, the Copperfield Street Community Gardeners for over 40 years and is supported by Bankside Open Spaces Trust (BOST).\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the church was used a recording studio, and was associated with some notable artists of the time. In 2001 the studios closed down and the building fell into gradual disrepair. At present the Cathedral has leased the units on a short-term basis to a housing co-operative who are using the former studios for temporary accommodation.",

It is said by Booth in 1899, to lead to gardens and a century earlier it did lead to an area shown as ‘garden ground’. It now runs pleasantly through a tree lined area past sports fields to Salter Way.\nSt Paul’s Chapel of Ease. This was a Chapel-of-Ease to St Mary's which never had its own parish built abut 1850 by a family member, architect William Beatson., but was consecrated. It had a simple layout with a north-east vestry. There was a small bell turret at the west end In 1892 timber from HMS Temeraire which was being broken up at Beatson’s Yard, was used to construct the altar and altar rails. It was may have been destroyed in Second World War bombing although registers continue to 1955 when it may have been demolished by some sort of mistake and ‘hushed up’. The site was sold to the Greater London Council for the site of the school in the late 1960s.",

That incidentally is why there’s a Peckham Hill street – it’s named after the former owners of the land. It’s said that Bird in Bush Road, which the park sits alongside is named after one of the fields that used to be in the area.\nThe specific details of why the block was demolished have not been found, but the area was suffered a severe decline in the 1970s, being one of the most deprived areas in Western Europe. Many houses in the area became run down and many houses were left empty. It seems that the council bought the entire block in the late 1970s with an intention to clear the land for later redevelopment. The whole block minus the pub on the corner was cleared in 1979.\nAn attempt by the council to then redevelop the land in 1988 was opposed by people living locally, who unsurprisingly liked having a park here, and it’s remained a park ever since.",

    "brief_history": "During the 18th Century the landscape was primarily used for agriculture and was a key area for droving livestock to markets in London. Few dwellings existed in the area at this time, and these consisted of large houses with landscaped gardens. Council records indicate that Greendale itself may never have been built upon. 19th Century \n\n1.22 Throughout the 19th Century there was a step change in the rate of urban expansion in the surrounding area. The arrival of the railway encouraged extensive developments in the area, as the surrounding areas of central London became more accessible. These were generally large houses with landscaped gardens, as seen to the north of the site (1870 OS Map). \n\n1.23 The 1870’s OS Map interestingly highlights an orchard located where the defunct tennis courts are currently found. A croquet lawn is also present (in green). Several ponds (highlighted in blue) are mapped in the local gardens. \n\n1.24 ‘Green Dale’ highlighted in yellow has existed as a public route for at least 140 years. \n\n1.25 The 1890’s OS Map illustrates one of the large residential dwellings to the north of the site has become Pelican House College for girls (purple) and the eastern half of the site has become a part of Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground. The running track to the south was probably part of the Alleyn’s independent school sports facilities. 20th Century \n\n1.26 In the 1910’s, Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground was developed in the current location of the artificial turf. The tennis courts were also built on the site of the croquet court to the north of the Greendale site. \n\n1.27 During this time the site is named Dulwich Grove and Wren Recreational Ground. Champion Hill Cricket and Lawn Tennis Ground dominated the current location of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium and Dulwich Hamlet Athletic Ground. These seem to have acquired a site to the east, adjacent to Dog Kennel Hill. \n\n1.28 Between the 1910’s and 1950’s a large amount of housing development occurred in the area. A housing boom meant that the majority of the open space to the west of the site was developed into semi-detached and terrace housing. To the north of the site, the large, historic dwellings were replaced by large blocks of flats set within a generous amount of open space. Camberwell Workhouse became St Francis Hospital. Dulwich Hamlet Football Ground was created, with a cricket pitch and tennis courts to the north of this. Additional tennis court were built within the northern half of the Greendale site, with the remainder of the site labelled as playing fields, with numerous pavilions.\n\n 1.29 All ponds that previously were shown on the plans have disappeared, probably filled in and any existing water sources culverted. 21st Century\n\n 1.30 The overgrown tennis courts are in the same location that can be seen from the 1910’s map. Generally, the overall layout of the site itself has changed very little over the last 100 years, with the biggest change being the all-weather surface that has been laid to service Dulwich Hamlet FC.\n\n 1.31 Sainsbury’s supermarket has been built on the site of the old football ground that was situated to the north of Dulwich Hamlet Football Stadium. 1.32 The historic ‘Green Dale’ access still exists as a shared pedestrian and cycle route running north to south, west of the site boundary.\n\nExcerpt taken from Greendale Management Plan - August 2017\n\nLooking at Southwark Councils old digitised maps it would appear that Greendale Fields was probably created some time between 1896 and 1916. Since 1916 it has maintained its current shape. Although whether the whole original area has remained publicly accessible is unclear. Until an exact opening date is found we will classify its opening date as 1875-1899.",

    "brief_history": "Greenland Dock is the oldest of London's riverside wet docks. It was created in 1695-1699 as Howland Great Dock on marshland within a rural area – London was much smaller then. The dock was also about half its present size at that time. At first the dock was used for re-fitting ships of the East India Company. From the 1720s it was used by whaling ships and whale blubber was boiled on the quayside to produce oil. The whaling ships came in from Greenland leading to the dock beng renamed Greenland Dock.\nIn 1806 the dock was sold to a timber merchant who constructed a series of shallow holding docks for timber. Greenland Dock formed part of the Surrey Commercial Docks, which handled 80% of London's timber trade. The dock was expanded to its present size in 1895-1904 and had many interconnecting timber ponds (see picture below). The expansion created a large entrance lock and a depth of 31 feet (9.4m) allowing much bigger ships to enter, such as Cunard A class liners carrying cargo and passengers between London and Canada. (Cunard Walk off Greenland Dock was named after this.)\nIn 1940 the Surrey Commercial Docks, along with major docks on the otherside of the Thames, were bombed at the beginning of the Blitz. On 7 September 1940, 348 German bombers escorted by 617 fighters attacked London in the late afternoon, forming a 20 mile-wide block of aircraft. Many of the bombs falling on the Surrey Docks were strapped to oil drums which ignited the timber ponds. The result was a firestorm that blazed for a whole week and could be seen for miles around. Firefighters came from as far away as Bristol to fight the blazes.\nAfter the war, the docks recovered but changes in shipping (containerisation) brought commercial use of Greenland Dock to an end in the late 1950s. The docks lay derelict until the 1980s when the London Dockland Development Corporation began developing the area. Greenland Dock and South Dock kept their water but many of the timber poinds were filled in. South Dock is nearby on the way to the river and is now a marina. On the otherside of Greenland Dock you will find Norway Dock, where houses are built in the water, and Russia Dock, which has been filled to make an attractive woodland park.",

    "brief_history": "King Edward III is remembered in history for starting the Hundred Years War, annexing large parts of France for England, as well as being the reigning king during the period of the Black Death. What he is infinitely less well-known for, is building a small royal residence at Rotherhithe in South East London, the remains of which can still be seen today.\nWhen the residence was constructed in around 1350, Rotherhithe was a small hamlet set in low lying marshland. The manor house itself was built upon a small island directly next to the River Thames and consisted of a range of stone buildings around a central courtyard.\n\nThere was a moat on three sides of the complex, with the north side being completely open to the River Thames. This allowed the king to arrive by boat and at high tide to moor up against the steps that led from the river to a gatehouse located in a tower. There was also a hall with a large and imposing fireplace, the king’s private chambers, kitchens and other buildings. Further south, on drier land, was an outer court with other buildings surrounded by an earth bank.\n\nSo what was the function of this manor house? It was not a hunting lodge, since there was no attached royal park and Edward III built many hunting lodges elsewhere. Indeed, the most popular theory is that this was where the king practiced his falconry, with the birds being able to stay within eyeshot across the flat marshlands and the River Thames.\n\nBy the end of the 16th century the Thames waterfront had been pushed northwards by land reclamation, and a road had been built along the new river embankment (today this road is known as Bermondsey Wall). By this time the old king’s residence was completely enclosed by the moat, and perhaps due to a lack of enthusiasm for falconry, Edward’s ancestors eventually sold the residence and it passed into private hands.\nIn the 18th century the site became used as a pottery and in the 18th and 19th centuries warehouses were built across the site. In fact the facade of the north wall of the 14th century inner court was still standing in 1907, incorporated into one of the warehouses.\n\nIn the 1970s the warehouses were demolished and in the 1980s the area was redeveloped, allowing historians at the Museum of London to excavate the remains, preserve them and make them accessible to the public.",

Residential development took place at the same time, and from the 1870s up to the mid 1970s the area now occupied by the Reserve was terraced housing, in Cossall Street and Sunwell Street (formerly Athearn Road).\n\nIn the 1970s the area was redeveloped with Southwark Council’s new Cossall Housing Estate, and a new road was built on the North side of the railway to extend the North end of Kirkwood Road to meet Queen’s Road. In the late 1990s the North section of this road was partially built over to construct Joe Richards House. The remaining portion of road was removed and the site landscaped to become the Kirkwood Road Nature Garden. The garden was opened in Autumn 2000. Most of the reserve was planted as woodland, with an artificial pond, some open grass areas and a path network. In the following 10 years the woodland has developed and the area is now a significant local wildlife resource.\n\n~ From a sign found in Kirkwood Road Nature Garden",

The excerpt below is referring to Lock Burial Ground.\n\n\"St George the Martyr had acquired an additional burial ground in 1711. This was situated in Kent Street near the Lock Hospital and next to St Saviour's and St Olave's Girls' School. It was extended in 1744 and, after its closure, was laid out as a public garden by the vestry in 1887.\"\n\nThe exact location of Lock Burial Ground was determined by looking at Southwark Council’s digitised historic maps. On a map dated 1873-1876 Lock Burial Ground is labelled as a disused burial ground. It can be found on multiple maps following that date but on a map dated 1951 the burial ground is no longer on the map. In it’s place is a blank space. Presumably the burial ground was closed and flattened sometime between 1916 and 1951.\n\n‘The Pilgrim Fathers Memorial Church, which originally stood at Deadman’s Place in Bankside was relocated in 1864 to Buckenham Square, close to this site. Its gardens were named the Mayflower Gardens and contained a memorial to the ship; a sundial set on a large stone with a panel depicting the Mayflower on one side. When the Bricklayers Arms flyover was built in the 1970s there was much disruption. The Pilgrim church moved to Great Dover Street but Mayflower Gardens was left behind, complete with its monument. St Saviour’s & St Olave’s School for Girls was built close by, and the memorial is now inside.’\n\nThe excerpt clearly mentions the fact that Mayflower Gardens is now located within St. Saviour’s & St. Olave’s School for girls. If you look on their website there is also reference to Mayflower Gardens being a part of the schools outdoor area. \n\nOn a map dated 2002, Mayflower Garden is still located adjacent to the school which would then suggest that Mayflower Garden stopped being publicly accessible sometime between 2002 and now.",

Although it became fashionable to be buried here, the cemetery suffered when the new Crystal Palace railway blocked the cemetery approach and the company secretary embezzled company funds. Over the C20th the once well-kept cemetery deteriorated and it closed in 1969, badly neglected and subject to attacks by vandals. Purchased by Southwark Council in 1975, it was later restored with the active participation of the Friends of Nunhead Cemetery, and re-opened in 2001, part now a nature reserve.",

    "brief_history": "South Dock is one of two surviving docks in the former Surrey Commercial Docks in Rotherhithe, London, England. It was built in 1807–1811 just south of the larger Greenland Dock, to which it is connected by a channel now known as Greenland Cut; it also has a lock giving access to the River Thames. Originally named the East Country Dock, it was renamed in 1850 when the Surrey Commercial Dock Company purchased and enlarged it. Timber and grain were the main products imported and exported in the dock.\n\nThe dock was seriously damaged by German attacks in World War II when the area was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe. Due to bomb damage in Greenland Dock, South Dock became the only exit from that dock. It was emptied of shipping in 1944, drained and used for the construction of concrete sections for the Mulberry Harbours used on D-Day. After the war, it was repaired and the surrounding warehouses rebuilt.\n\nThe revival of the Surrey Docks proved short-lived with the advent of containerization from the 1960s onwards. The new container ships were much too big to be accommodated in the upstream London docks and, with a few exceptions, most of the river trade moved downriver to Tilbury and other more modern ports around the country. The Surrey Docks closed in December 1970 and were sold to the London Borough of Southwark in 1977.\n\nAlthough most of the Surrey Docks were infilled and converted to residential, commercial or light industrial land, South Dock escaped this fate. The former warehouses were demolished and replaced with residential blocks, while the dock itself was refurbished. Residential development in the area received funding from the London Docklands Development Corporation erecting unique buildings, such as Baltic Quay. In 1994, South Dock reopened as London's largest marina, with over 200 berths. It is now largely occupied by yachts and residential barges.",

The new church was Sir George Gilbert Scott's first major gothic building. The walled churchyard was in use until 1856, having been enlarged in 1717, 1803 and 1825. After its closure it became neglected and part was lost when Peckham Road was widened. It was cleared of graves in 1939 and laid out as a public garden, with headstones forming a wall on the northern end. It contains mature trees and a few tombs remain in the grass.",
