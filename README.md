This is the repository for the London Parkive which is an archive of London's parks and open spaces (you can view the website at https://londonparkive.com). 
Its USP that makes it different from all the other websites on parks around London is that it shows the evolution of London's parks and open spaces.
For example, you can see parks that no longer exist anymore or if a park has been expanded or shrunk since it was first opened. 
This is the final project for my BA Design degree and is by no means in a completed state. 
The website is functional but in a completed state would include much more information on the parks it is depicting. 
It is also worth noting that the London Parkive currently only covers the borough of Southwark AND does not show a full depiction of all the parks there. 
But I hope it demonstrates the potential of what the London Parkive could be if more time was dedicated to researching and building it.
